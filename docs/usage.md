## Downloads

* [0.1 version](/assets/0.1/mjargon.jar)
* [0.2 version](/assets/0.2/mjargon.jar)

## Usage

Copy the jar to your computer and execute:

	$ java -jar <path-to-mjargon.jar> <.mjargon-file>

where *path-to-mjargon.jar* is where the file was copied and *.mjargon-file* is a Music Jargon file. See the end of the tutorial for a well known riff.

If you are running on linux you may be able to set an alias for the command to avoid the *java -jar* part. If running on a bash based system, add the following in your *.bash_aliases:

	alias mjargon='java -jar <path-to-mjargon-.jar>'

Then you can execute simply:

	$ mjargon <.mjargon-file>
