# MusicJargon

MusicJargon is a high level musical notation that allows to represent aurally perceived music played with instruments or sung by the human voice through the use of text files.

It separates the different aspects of music and allows to transform and combine them to produce something we can hear. In a music staff, each note has a pitch, a strength and a duration which is defined by one or more complex symbols in a pentagram. In MusicJargon these concepts are independent and can be defined in one place and be reused on different places, combined differently, etc. For example it is possible to define a rhythm that will be reused in two parts of a song with a different sequence of notes.

Currently it is able to output MIDI files.

MusicJargon is open source.
