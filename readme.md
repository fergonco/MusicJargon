# MusicJargon

MusicJargon is a high level musical notation that allows to represent aurally perceived music played with instruments or sung by the human voice through the use of text files.

Currently it is able to output MIDI files.

## Usage

## Notation

MusicJargon works by splitting the concept of rhythm and the concept of pitch. In a music staff, each note has a pitch, a strength and a duration which is defined by one or more complex symbols in a pentagram. In MusicJargon there is no pentagram, just a text file with ascii (well, not only) characters. In order to specify "play a C# on the 7th octave very loud and lasting a quarter note" it is necessary to specify things in several places.

## Time signatures

Time signature expressions follow this notation:

	<number>/<number>

They can be used as literals when defining rhythms or declaring a named time_signature:

	<name> = time signature <time_signature_literal>

## Rhythms

Rhythms define note duration and a dynamic variation (the base dynamic is defined in the bar section). They are defined this way:

	<name> = rhythm [<rhythm_literal>] on <time_signature>

*rhythm_literal* is a sequence of *X* *x* and *.*, with these meanings:

* *.*: no beat
* *x*: normal note
* *X*: slightly higher note

and *time_signature* is a time signature expression.

Note that the length of the notes depends on the time signature and it is automatically calculated. For example, in this rhythm:

	quarterRhythm = rhythm [XXXX] on 4/4

Each *X* repressents a quarter note. In this one:

	eighthRhythm = rhythm [XxXxXxXx] on 4/4

each character repressents a eighth note.


So, we could define a We will rock you rhythm like this:

	wwry = rhythm [xxX.xxX.] on 4/4

## Bar section

Once there is a rhythm, one can place notes over it. We enter the bars section, which defines instruments, matches notes with rhythms, sets tempo, changes dynamics, etc. As opposed to pentagrams, MusicJargon lays the song vertically and the *|* character separates the different voices that sound at the same time.

## Voices

Voices are the first line on the bar section and define the instruments:

	voices | <instrument_name> "comment" | <instrument_name> "comment" | ...

See TODO for a list of possible instruments.

Note that some instruments have two voices and they have to be added explicitly, for example the two hands for piano:

	voices | piano "left hand" | piano "right hand"

Note also that the vertical bar *|* separates both instruments

## Bar

Bars come vertically after one another under the corresponding instrument:

	voices | piano "left hand" | piano "right hand"
	       | <bar>             | <bar>
	       | <bar>             | <bar>
	       | <bar>             | <bar>
	       | ...               | ...

Note that formatting is not important but instead the number of | characters is taken into account to know to which voice belongs each bar. An editor with block editing capabilities or aligning capabilities is recommended.

The syntax of individual bars is the following:

	<note_sequence> on <rhythm_name>

Where *note_sequence* defines a sequence of notes, which can be pitched notes (C, D, Eâ™¯, etc.) or drumm "notes" (hihat, snare, etc.), and *rhythm_name* points to a previously defined rhythm.

The logic is the same in both pitched and drum sequences: match each *X* or *x* component from the rhythm with the note that takes the same place in the sequence. For example:
	
	myRhythm = rhythm [XxX.X...] on 4/4
	voices | piano
	       | A B C D on myRythm

would play a *A* eighth note, a B eighth note, a C quarter note and a D half note.

If the sequence is shorter than the rhythm it is rolled over, which is very useful for drum sequences. For example, this would play an accented hihat (hh) eighth note, followed by a normal open hihat eighth note and, as the sequence is over, it will start again with another two hihat and open hihat eighth notes until the rhythm is filled:

	theBeat = rhythm [XxXxXxXx] on 4/4
	voices | drums
	       | hh hho on theBeat

### Pitched sequences

* t4
* tom5
* t5
* tom6
* t6

## Voices not playing a bar

Just leave the bar empty. Empty bars make the corresponding voice mute during the bar.

## Tempo

Tempo lines can appear at any place in the bar section. Its syntax is:

	tempo [<note_fraction>=] <bpm> | ...

where *bpm* is the beats per minute and *note_fraction* is the fraction that identifies the note length. It is 1/4 (a quarter note) by default.

Note that in order to define the tempo for a doted quarter note you have to add 1/4 and 1/8 which gives 3/8:

	tempo 3/8=60

The tempo declaration can have any number of | charaters afterwards, with no meaning at all but allowing for nice formatting and alignment.

## Dynamics

Dynamics can appear at any place in the bar section. Its syntax is:

	dynamics | <dynamic> | <dynamic> | ...

where *dynamic* is one of:

* pppp
* ppp
* pp
* p
* mp
* mf
* f
* ff
* fff
* ffff
* empty, for no dynamic change

For example, in the following section the left hand and right hand of piano are balanced and afterwards the right hand is a bit louder while the right hand does not change:

	voices   | piano "left hand" | piano "right hand"
	tempo 70 |                   |
	dynamics | mf                | mf
			 | CEG               | C E G on myRhythm
	dynamics |                   | f
			 | CEG               | C E G on myRhythm
